# fragments-App-demo

Fragments-App-Demo is a submission to the challenge hosted by the Fragments Bot app company for their internship program.

It is made for demonstrating a simple chat application with the following specific features:

 - POST to an API. Posts to [Fragments Backend](http://fragmentstanvir.azurewebsites.net/messages) (DONE)
 
 - When there is no network connection available, the app saves the message and its time to a database as POST request parameter. For example: text=hhhh&time=1491400605485

 -  When there's a network (Wifi or Mobile), the app receives a broadcast indicating the change in the network. (DONE) 
 
 - On receiving the broadcast, the app checks whether there are messages to be sent in the Database. 
 
 - If there are messages to be sent, then it sends the messages one by one.
